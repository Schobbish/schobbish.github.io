					<h2>About Me</h2>
					<p>Hello, I am Nathaniel Lukas Adam and I go to West Linn High School. I first learned how to make websites in 6th grade. One of the first moderately good looking websites are featured on my home page (the "Where's Nathan?" website). Since then I have gotten progressively better and better at making websites. Currently, I know HTML, CSS, and jQuery (I'm not so good at vanilla JavaScript), as well as a bit of PHP and SQL. Soon I will create a substitute for Citation Machine because I am sick and tired of seeing all those ads.</p>

				<h3>About This Website</h3>
				<p>This website is my final project for my Web Design/Production II class. Each main page is broken up into a header, main section, and footer. All of the main pages use the same header.php and footer.php. I also use the Slidebars plugin to create the that snazzy menu, as well as jQuery Color for the snazzy hover effects. I use three fonts: Boogaloo for the header, Source Serif Pro for main headings, and Montserrat for all other text. In the future I plan to make the CSS for streamlined and efficent throughout the website, and make the contact form go to a different website when one of more fields are empty (currently it submits no matter what). Fun fact: the contact form doesn't actually emails me; the response is stored in a database.</p>
